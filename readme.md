# About Music Bar

Just a simple wrapper around lemonbar/mpd/mpc to display info and control the playback.

Support for cmus may be added later, but that's not decided yet.


## Dependencies

- [Siji font](https://github.com/stark/siji/) for the iconic glyphs
- [Mkb](http://git.z3bra.org/mkb/log.html) for drawing the progress bar
