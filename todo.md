# Desired Features

- [ ] Visual feedback by reversing the attribute (Not limited to underline/overline) of an icon on click.
- [ ] Different color of feedback based on the mouse button.
- [ ] Add support for cmus by writing modules.

# Code refactoring

- [ ] Massive clean up needed !
- [ ] The code needs to be more modular so that it's easiy to add/remove modules, adding support for other players such as cmus shouldn't breaking anything.
- [ ] A separate config file with a set of standard environment variables (lemonbar example: FONT, GEOM, color names, etc).
- [ ] Improve readability (add more comments, sensible variable and function names).
- [ ] Code optimization (Use of less pipes through better regex).

# Documentation

- [ ] Document each of the modules.
- [ ] Explain the necessary functions and variables which makes all this work.
